# Advanced SQL Queries and Aggregations Assignment

This repository contains the solution to the Advanced SQL Queries and Aggregations assignment. The goal is to practice using SQL aggregation functions, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and filtering techniques to analyze data from a sample database (e.g., MySQL Sample Database – classicmodels).

## 📁 Files Included

- `answers.sql` – Contains all SQL queries for the four assignment questions.
- `README.md` – This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use aggregation functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`.
- Apply `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to organize results.
- Filter and structure data efficiently.
- Use `LIMIT` to restrict output.

## 🛠️ Database Setup

This assignment assumes the use of a relational database system such as **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**. The queries are written for **MySQL**, using tables like:
- `payments`
- `customers`
- `orderdetails`

> 💡 Make sure the sample database (e.g., `classicmodels`) is imported and the MySQL server is running.

### How to Run the Queries
1. Start your MySQL server.
2. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
3. Connect to your database.
4. Open and execute the `answers.sql` file.

## ❓ Assignment Questions & Solutions

The `answers.sql` file includes solutions to the following:

1. **Total payment amount per payment
